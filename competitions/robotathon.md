## Welcome to Robotathon 2015!

Add yourself to the UT RAS [<span class="bodyLink">mailing list</span>](http://goo.gl/forms/jbfS0aeWV5) to keep up-to-date on news and announcements.

### So What is Robotathon?

Robotathon is an annual event held every Fall semester at the University of Texas at Austin by the [<span class="bodyLink">UT IEEE Robotics and Automation Society</span>](robotathon.html#ut-ras) (RAS [_răz_]). This competition is essentially a two month long bootcamp for robotics culminating in a large, sports-like competition that pits each teams’ robot against each other in a tournament style battle-to-the-death (not really) for glory and honor (and bragging rights). It is designed for [<span class="bodyLink">both robotics veterans and newcomers alike</span>](robotathon.html#what-do-i-need-to-know-to-participate). Each Fall, around 100 people arranged in teams of 6 participate in this competition developed entirely in-house by RAS Leaders to be entertaining, challenging, and relevant to important basic concepts in robotics.

### What is this year’s competition?

  That information happens to be top secret! We design a fresh competition every year, and this year’s will be revealed at the Robotathon Kickoff in late September.

### When does Robotathon happen?

  The kickoff for Robotathon 2015 is scheduled for late September; this is when teams will be assigned and will begin to receive their parts. Starting in early September and lasting up until the competition, we will hold sets of weekly workshops covering topics from mechanical design to advanced algorithms for robotics. In addition, once Robotathon gets rolling, weekly checkpoints will due for points that will count towards your final competition score. Robotathon itself is held in late November: the Monday of Thanksgiving Week in fact!

### Checkpoints?

  Checkpoints are a set of weekly ‘tasks’ that help keep teams on track for the competition. They are due by the beginning of Saturday (12:00 AM Saturday Morning/Friday Night), and while they are not required, they help you earn points towards your final competition score! They include tasks such as design proposals, documentation, PCB soldering, and algorithm implementation.

### And Workshops?

  Starting in early September, various leaders in RAS will hold talks twice a week (Wednesday/Thursday) in the evening on topics that in which they are experts. These cover various facets of robotics, and the first three are designed to help everyone build a solid foundation for Robotathon before it starts at the end of the month. Once the competition starts, workshops will help teach topics related to the competition and they will provide an open forum for any questions. Each team also has an upperclassmen mentor from RAS to help guide them along the way as well.

### What do I need to know to participate?

  Absolutely nothing! All you need is a open mind and a desire to learn. While it is a competition, above all this is a learning experience designed to help teach robotics to those that want to learn. In addition, all participants are generally on the same level, because this competition is restricted to newcomers to RAS, which happens to be primarily freshmen!


### Who can compete?

  Around 100 students are selected among those who sign up to participate in teams of 6 people. Each team is assigned a mentor who is an upperclassmen that has been through the competition before; however, we design a new competition every year for this event, so they won’t be able to give you the optimal solution from experience! As mentioned, this competition is aimed for those new to college robotics, so students are only allowed to compete once. Students that wish to help out in future years then become mentors!


### How do I sign up?

  Well, sign-ups for Robotathon aren’t up yet. They will be up starting at the first general meeting for UT IEEE RAS in the Fall! If you are really excited to participate, make sure to include your information [<span class="bodyLink">here</span>](http://goo.gl/forms/jbfS0aeWV5) so that we can add you directly to our mailing list at the end of the summer!

  In addition, you may have noticed that it said we select around 100 people to participate. This event always has a bunch of people that are interested, and while we try to take as many people as we can, we don’t always have the resources to hold everyone. We use the initial workshops and general meetings to gauge interest, so make sure to keep an eye out for them this Fall!

### First General Meeting

  RAS’s first general meeting, which will cover Robotathon and everything we do as a student org at the University of Texas at Austin will be Tuesday, September 1st, at 7:00PM. Location is TBA at the moment.

### UT RAS

  UT RAS is the organization that puts on this event. We are entirely student operated, and are also one of the most prominent organizations in Cockrell School of Engineering because we are primarily a project based organization. This means that in addition to our awesome social events, there is almost always something being built in our office during the academic year.

  We frequently demo for UT open houses, local STEM events, and incoming engineering freshmen, so you may have seen us around already!

## FAQ

#### Do I have to be a UT student to participate/attend?
Yes. This is currently an event for only UT students. In addition, you can not have participated in a previous year’s Robotathon.

#### Does this cost anything?
Unfortunately, yes. To participate in Robotathon, you have to pay a fee for parts in addition to RAS dues for the semester. Generally this is in the area of $30.

#### How much time does this take?
The time frame for the event is about two months; but participating in the event is requires about the same amount of time as a light class. The big difference here is that Robotathon, unlike many first semester classes, is very hands on and practical event. By participating in Robotathon, you will learn a large amount of information that you won’t even touch on in classes until Sophomore, Junior, or even Senior year. It does require some effort to be put forth, but it is very much worth it.


#### Any further questions about Robotathon or RAS?

  Our office is in ACA 101. During the summer, people may or may not be in the office at any given time due to Summer commitments, but stop by and check if the door is open!

  For any addition questions, concerns, clarifications, etc, feel free to contact us. Occasionally, we will update the FAQ with relevant questions, so check back later to see if there is more information.
