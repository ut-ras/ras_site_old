We’ve reached an early and unexpected end to our semester. While we were not able to compete this year due to the Coronavirus pandemic, we have made progress on creating a new micromouse. A major modification in the new micromouse is changing the microcontroller from an ESP32 to a TM4C.

Currently, we’ve finalized the schematic and ordered parts. Our priority when we get started again is to finish our PCB layout and order it. We have a lot of work ahead of us, including a lot of programming and assembly. We’re always looking for more members, so if you’re interested in joining Micromouse please talk to a member or email [alljiang@utexas.edu](mailto:alljiang@utexas.edu). We’re looking forward to our next meeting!
