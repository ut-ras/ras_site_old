We have ordered initial parts and will be testing in the coming weeks!

The [recycling themed Region V Robotics Competition](https://r5conferences.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/126/Robotics_Game_Manual.pdf) will be taking place April 4, 2020. There will be a scrimmage that will be held this November which we will not be attending due to expenses but we hope to review video and make edits to our game plan if needed.

The team has completed the first iteration of our design and will continue refining subsystems of the robot. We have also gotten the motors/encoders and raspberry pi 4 in and now we will begin testing.

Up next will be getting our conveyor ordered along with prototyping funnels and bins! We will then start combining subsystems to test bigger systems of our robot.
