In addition to building robots, RAS organizes an intramural team every spring semester. This year, we will compete in sand volleyball!

‘Compete’ might be a strong word, but we definitely have a blast. Last year we did pretty well in IM ultimate Frisbee, so we hope to carry this success into 2018.

#### IM Ultimate 2017

Sand volleyball is played 4-on-4 with a roster of 10. We have a few months to organize and practice, as our games will be played late March and April.

Additionally, RAS has other social events, such as board game nights and video game competitions. This year might introduce trivia or karaoke, so keep on the lookout for that at #general slack channel!
