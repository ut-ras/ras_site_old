The Demobot Committee undertakes projects to maintain and refurbish existing
robots as well as design and build new ones.

This semester the Demobot Committee
is focusing on four projects, the restoration of the 2015 Mercury Robotics
Competition entry named “Nessie,” the restoration of “Robocouch”, a
self-balancing single axle robot, and an arcade style crane machine. The self
balancing robot and crane machine, both to be named, are being developed by two
groups headed by 1st year ECE students.

### Nessie

Rapid redesign of the robot Nessie took place in the early part of Spring 2016.
Now, construction on Nessie is complete and the next steps include implementing
software and wireless communication, testing, and documentation. The
improvements made over the 2015 model of Nessie will integrate remote control
and a wireless FPV camera, turning the robot into the ultimate reconnaissance
vehicle.

### RoboCouch

RoboCouch, the motorized sleeping unit which occupies valuable space in ACA 101,
is being retrofitted with new batteries, electrical connections, and
controllers. The final task is to reprogram microcontrollers for the couch and
take the machine on its maiden voyage up the gruesome climb that is Dean Keaton.
