Over the past couple of weeks, micromouse has been getting ready to build their prototype robot. The printed circuit board was ordered, and all of the parts required have been shipped. Once the PCB arrives, we will build the robot, and improve our control algorithms.

PCB:

Controls:
On the controls end, we have been working on porting the pid control that was previously used in pacbot. We plan on testing these controls with the new pcb. Once these basic controls are implemented, we would also like to explore more complicated controls like curve turns and diagonal dashing.
