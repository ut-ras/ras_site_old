The Fall 2018 semester is more than halfway over, and UT IEEE RAS has had a great semester thus far.

We continue to have general meetings every other Tuesday while our different committees hold their respective meetings every week. Be sure to check out the blog posts in order to get an update on what they are each up to!

We have had multiple general meetings since our last general RAS update.

On Sept 11, we held our 2nd general meeting. Our guest speaker, Fawzi Behmann, gave us a talk about Internet of Things.
