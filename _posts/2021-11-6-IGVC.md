IGVC is a competitive RAS committee whose main goal is to work with autonomous robots. The objective of the competition is to navigate through an obstacle course under a specific amount of time all autonomously. The course is about half the size of a football field and the robot itself is about the same length and width as a golf cart. <!--more-->

IGVC’s goals for the semester are to finish building the robot. This includes finishing assembling the motor mounts, machining axles, and mounting different plates onto the robot all before the end of the semester.

IGVC’s goals for the software subteam is to have all the sensors calibrated and functioning so that for the next semester we can start immediately working on algorithms to navigate through the course.

So far this semester, IGVC has finished manufacturing plates for the robot and mounted them to the robot. Also, IGVC is almost done mounting the lidar plate onto the robot. So, we are close to finishing the semester on track.
