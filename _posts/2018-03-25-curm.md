For those unfamiliar, the Convention for Unconventional Robotic Movement is an annual showcasing of original robots, made to move in any unconventional manner. We loosely define this as not relying on conventional wheels (like a car) or treads (like a tank). In the past, this has ranged from a slug bot that actually leaves a trail of oil to a hopping robot with a several-foot vertical to a robot that manipulates its center of mass to slowly inch forward.

#### Updates:

 - CURM held their second social of the year at Posse East

 - We got the attendance confirmation of last year’s favorite participant, Dr. Robert Read. He will be entering a research project and will likely be showing and explaining a simulation of his movement mapping algorithms. 

 - Several more have applied to CURM but it’s not too late if you have an idea!
