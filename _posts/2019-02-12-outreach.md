IEEE RAS had our first outreach event of the year at this year’s Edison Lectures. Students of all ages come to the University of Texas on this day to see the STEM projects brought by UT students and companies. IEEE RAS showcased a few of our robots, including a 150 pound robot designed to carry cargo. The members of RAS who attended discussed robotics with the students and talked about what it’s like to be an engineering student at UT. We even let the students drive the cargo robot. In the near future, RAS will also be at Introduce a Girl to Engineering and Explore UT.
