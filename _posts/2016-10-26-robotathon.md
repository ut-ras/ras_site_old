Robotathon is a UT-hosted robotics competition targeted towards incoming freshmen, transfer students, and anyone else interested in learning about robots.

This year will be RAS’ biggest Robotathon event ever with over 150 participants! We have decided to go all out and make the competition Pokemon-themed, where 2 robots face off to gather Pokeballs and capture Pokemon, scoring as many points as possible within the time limit.

Students complete weekly objectives to learn skills such as electronics, mechanical design, and programming. This knowledge is used to build a robot that can combine sensory inputs to track a line, follow a wall, and catch ‘em all! This year’s competition will be held on the evening of Monday, Novemeber 21st at 7pm, and it is open to the public.
