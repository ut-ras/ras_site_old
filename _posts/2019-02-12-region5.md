Region V's Spring semester has begun, which promises to be especially exciting with our competition quickly approaching in April.

We are currently wrapping up the majority of our mechanical design, with the implementation of a guillotine-like block raising mechanism reaching it's final stages. Our PCB design is progressing, and will top off the main tasks needed to have a complete assembled robot ready to run the course within the next couple of weeks.

Additionally, we have successfully achieved motor control with encoder feedback on our Raspberry Pi Zero Ws this week. This allows us to mitigate the need for an additional Arduino to handle real-time motor control, and thus to achieve the most compact robots to make our swarm a reality!
