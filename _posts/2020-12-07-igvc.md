Over the past few weeks, IGVC has just been continuing the crash courses. These crash courses are introductory courses for Python and Linux, which are very important in having the robot able to function properly. <!--more--> Whether or not students have prior knowledge or experience with these languages does not matter at all! We can teach you everything you need to know. Other than crash courses, IGVC will continue finishing up construction of the robot over the next semester. Hope to see you there!

If you are interested in IGVC, we have three main subteams: mechanical, electrical, and software. Regardless of if you have experience in these fields doesn’t matter as we can teach y’all everything you need to know. Hopefully, these blog posts have been informative and if you’re confused about anything or have any questions, email me at pjmathews731@utexas.edu. Thanks!
