The Spring 2018 semester has started and its kicked off with a great start.

On Saturday, February 2nd RAS held its first social for the spring semester. Members of RAS joined up with members of PES (Power and Energy Society) for a fun evening in the Union Underground. Activities included board games, pool (billiards), and bowling.

There will be more events throughout the semester so if you didn’t come to this one, no worries!

There will soon also be smaller socials that will have cards, board games, video games, etc. where we can all chill and get to know each other better. Information on that will be coming soon.
