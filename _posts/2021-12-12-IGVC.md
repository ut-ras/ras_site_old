Over this past semester, IGVC has focused on the construction of the competition robot. <!--more-->The plate that the LiDAR component will be mounted on was attached to the robot. Similarly, the back plates covering the electrical board were also attached to the robot. Lastly, the brackets used to hold the drivetrain together was also mounted onto the robot. So the mechanical subteam has been busy this semester! 

The software subteam needs to just write the algorithms for navigation around the course. Also, the electrical subteam has mounted a couple of its components including the motor controller and the psu module onto the board. In terms of the electrical subteam, all that is left is to connect all of the components that are now on the robot. IGVC has had a great semester and is looking forward to the next one!
