      <p> inspires greater research into the field of robotics and aims to make robotics more accessible to persons of all ages and backgrounds. We have been a student organization building robots since 1997 and have primary residence in the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department. Our group has a large majority of undergraduate students with backgrounds from mechanical, electrical, aerospace engineering and computer science. We help students gain practical multi-disciplinary experience in the lab and demonstrate our abilities at various robotics competitions. We also keep a high priority in community outreach with our periodic events.</p>
